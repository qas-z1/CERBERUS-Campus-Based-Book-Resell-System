# 📚 CampusBook UiTM Tapah

A web-based peer-to-peer marketplace application designed specifically to facilitate secure textbook trading among students at **Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) Tapah Campus**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**CampusBook-UiTM** provides a dedicated platform for university students to list, browse, and exchange textbooks directly with one another. By moving away from general marketplaces like Carousell or Facebook Marketplace, this application ensures a **targeted, campus-specific environment** for academic resources, streamlined communication, and verified transactions between peers.

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Students at UiTM Tapah face challenges when buying and selling used textbooks:
- General marketplaces lack campus-specific filtering
- Difficulty verifying buyer/seller legitimacy
- Unsafe physical meetups for book handovers
- No standardized pricing or condition standards
- Limited discoverability of available textbooks within the campus community

### 💡 Solution

CampusBook provides:
- **Campus-isolated marketplace** — Only UiTM Tapah students can access listings
- **Secure handover protocol** — OTP-based verification during physical exchanges
- **Community trust** — In-campus, verified user profiles
- **Efficient discovery** — Filter by course, semester, condition, and price

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time Textbook Listings**
- Users can seamlessly **list textbooks** with details: title, author, course code, condition, price, and images

  - Display name and avatar
  - Verified status
  - Transaction history
  - User ratings and reviews (1-5 stars)
  - "Completed Transactions" badge
- Build trust within the campus community

### 5. **Messaging & Communication**
- In-app messaging between buyer and seller
- Negotiation of prices and meeting details
- Message history stored in Firestore
- Real-time notifications for new messages

### 6. **Payment Integration** (Optional)
- Support for cash payment (primary method)
- Future: Bank transfer or mobile payment options
